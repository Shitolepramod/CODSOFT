                chatrapati Shivaji maharaj (Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale; Marathi pronunciation: [ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7]
Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji used the difficult terrain of Western Ghats to his advantage. He captured and built new Hill Forts in Sahyadri Mountain range which proved very difficult for invading forces to capture, particularly Mughal armies. Shivaji perfected and used guerilla warfare to great success against much larger armies of Mughals and Deccan Sultanates.[8] Shivaji built a navy which maintained supremacy over the Konkan coast, and kept the Royal Navy in check.[9]
Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.[7][10] Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women,[11] Shivaji employedpeople of all castes in his administration and armypeople of all castes in his administration and army.
